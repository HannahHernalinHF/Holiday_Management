A. The HMT_Impact_Analysis.sql script calculates the daily pause, cancellation, and active rates for customers with deliveries scheduled on a public holiday, comparing them to customers whose delivery dates were originally on a public holiday but were shifted by the HMT.

B. The HMT_Tracker_Dashboard.sql script retrieves postal codes/customers along with their delivery dates and other attributes (such as packing day, cutoff, and surcharge), categorizing them as either shifted or non-shifted (impacted or not impacted by the HMT). 
This will be used as a source for the HMT Tracker Dashboard which is currently in progress.
